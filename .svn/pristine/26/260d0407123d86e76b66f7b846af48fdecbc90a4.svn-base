 * Abstract mixed data dictionary interface
 * A mixed data dictionary can hold multiple value types and retrieve those
 * values in a type-safe manner.   The use of a MixedDataKey is required 
 * as this special key carries typing information.   This guarantees that 
 * the type of the values associated with the key match the type specified
 * by the key.  Thus, no casting of the value returned by a "get" operation 
 * is necessary.
